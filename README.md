This project runs a SPARQL endpoint for Update and Select Queries and enables versioning with Git for each [Named Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_graph).

## Preparation of the Store repository

1. Create a directory, which will contain your RDF data
2. Run `git init` in this directory
3. Put your RDF data formated as [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-quads-20140225/) into this directory (an empty file should work as well)
4. Add the data to the repository (`git add â€¦`) and create a commit (`git commit -m "init repository"`)
5. Create a configuration file named `config.ttl` (an example is contained in this directory)

## Configuaration of config.ttl

Adjust the `config.ttl`.
Make sure you put the correct path to your git repository (`"../store"`) and the URI of your graph (`<http://example.org/>`) and name of the file holding this graph (`"example.nq"`).

```
conf:store a <YourQuitStore> ;
    <pathOfGitRepo> "../store" . # Set the path to the repository that contains the files .

conf:example a <Graph> ; # Define a Graph resource for a named graph
    <graphUri> <http://example.org/> ; # Set the URI of named graph
    <isVersioned> 1 ; # Defaults to True, future work
    <hasQuadFile> "example.nq" . # Set the filename
```

The `config.ttl` could as well be put under version controll for collaboration, but this is not neccessary.

## Run from command line

Install [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) and optionally [virtualenv resp. virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html):
```
pip install virtualenv
cd /path/to/this/repo
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 quit
```

Install the required dependencies and run the store:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./quit.py
```

## API

Execute a query with curl

```
curl -X POST -L -T path/to/query/file  http://your.host/sparql
```

Get commits, messages, committer and date of commits

```
http://your.host/git/log
```

## Tips and Tricks

If you want to convert an N-Triples file to N-Quads where all data is in the same graph, the following line might help.

    sed "s/.$/<http:\/\/example.org\/> ./g" data.nt > data.nq

## TODO:

Reinit store with data from commit with id

```
http://your.host/git/checkout?commitid=12345
```
