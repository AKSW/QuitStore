# Quit-Store

Status of `master` branch:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AKSW/QuitStore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AKSW/QuitStore)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AKSW/QuitStore/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/AKSW/QuitStore)

This project runs a SPARQL endpoint for Update and Select Queries and enables versioning with Git for each [Named Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_graph).

## Preparation of the Store repository

1. Create a directory, which will contain your RDF data
2. Run `git init` in this directory
3. Put your RDF data formated as [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-quads-20140225/) into this directory (an empty file should work as well)
4. Add the data to the repository (`git add â€¦`) and create a commit (`git commit -m "init repository"`)
5. Create a configuration file named `config.ttl` (an example is contained in this directory)

## Configuaration of config.ttl

Adjust the `config.ttl`.
Make sure you put the correct path to your git repository (`"../store"`) and the URI of your graph (`<http://example.org/>`) and name of the file holding this graph (`"example.nq"`).

```
conf:store a <YourQuitStore> ;
    <pathOfGitRepo> "../store" ; # Set the path to the repository that contains the files .
    <origin> "git:github.com/your/repository.git" . # Optional a git repo that will be cloned into dir given in line above on startup.


conf:example a <Graph> ; # Define a Graph resource for a named graph
    <graphUri> <http://example.org/> ; # Set the URI of named graph
    <isVersioned> 1 ; # Defaults to True, future work
    <hasQuadFile> "example.nq" . # Set the filename
```

The `config.ttl` could as well be put under version controll for collaboration, but this is not neccessary.

## Run from command line

Install [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) needed for pygit2 bindings.
Install [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) and optionally [virtualenv resp. virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html):
```
pip install virtualenv
cd /path/to/this/repo
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 quit
```

Install the required dependencies and run the store:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./quit.py
```

### Command line options
`-cm`, `--configmode`

Quit-Store can be started in three different modes.
These modes differ in how the store choses the named graphs and the corresponding files that will be part of the store.

1. localconfig - Use the graphs specified in a local config file (e.g. `config.ttl`).
2. repoconfig - Search for a `config.ttl` file in the specified repository.
3. graphfiles - Use `*.graph` files for each RDF file or analyze found N-Quads files to get the URI of named graphs.

`-t`, `--targetdir`

Specifiy a target directory where the repository can be found or will be cloned (if remote is given) to.

`-r`, `-repourl`

Specifiy a link/URI to a remote repository.

`-c`, `--configfile`

Specify a path to a configuration file. (Defaults to ./config.ttl)

`-nv`, `--disableversioning`

Run Quit-Store without versioning activated

`-gc`, `--garbagecollection`

Enable garbage collection. With this option activated, git will check for garbage collection after each commit. This may slow down response time but will keep the repository size small.

## API

Execute a query with curl

```
curl -X POST -L -T path/to/query/file  http://your.host/sparql
```

Get commits, messages, committer and date of commits

```
http://your.host/git/log
```

## Tips and Tricks

If you want to convert an N-Triples file to N-Quads where all data is in the same graph, the following line might help.

    sed "s/.$/<http:\/\/example.org\/> ./g" data.nt > data.nq

## Docker

You can also build a docker image and run a container of the Quit-Store. The Image will expose port 80 by default and expects an existing git repository including a config.ttl  ([see](#configuration-of-config.ttl)). Make sure to change the setting for the path to the git repository to the following value.

```
conf:store <pathOfGitRepo> "." .
```
To build the image and start your Quit-Store container insert:

```
cd /path/to/this/repo
docker build . -t imagename
docker run --name containername -v /existing/store/repo:/data imagename
```

Optionally you can change the container port by adding the variable QUIT_PORT (default: 80).

The following example will change the container port and will map the new port to the host port 80.

```
docker run --name containername -e QUIT_HOST=172.16.1.2 -e QUIT_PORT=8080 -p 80:8080 -v /existing/store.repo:/data imagename
```

## TODO:

Reinit store with data from commit with id
